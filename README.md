# CPU-SIMULATOR
This program simulates a system that processes jobs arriving in a queue. It uses a heap data structure to keep track of the jobs, and simulates the processors using an array of Processor objects. The program reads a file of jobs, creates them and puts them in a JobStack, then starts a loop that runs for 10000 time units. In each iteration of the loop, it removes completed jobs from the processors, adds new jobs to the heap, processes the jobs in the heap, and reports the status of the system to an output file. The program also keeps track of various statistics such as the number of completed jobs, the total wait time, and the number of jobs of each type that arrived and completed. The user is prompted to enter the number of processors they want to use.
